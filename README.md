## Description

This project is to show my understanding of the use of node.js in terminal. During this project I used the inquirer npm to make a README.md generator. Now if I ever need to make a quick README.md, I can use this generator and know that it will do what I need it to. From this generator I learned how to read documentation on the npm in use and put it to work. I learned how to write the functions needed and how to call them when needed to complete the input questions. I also learned how to use fs and create a new file using the information inputted.
